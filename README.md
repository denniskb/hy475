# Interactive Online Robotics Course
A collection of accompanying, tutorial-style assignments for ["HY 475--Robotic Navigation"](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy475/index.html) (CSD, University of Crete). Each assignment is based on its own interactive JavaScript robot simulator such as [this one](https://denniskb.github.io/hy475/assign3), allowing you to code and run directly in your browser. Feel free to ask (and answer) questions via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/denniskb/hy475/issues) and contribute to the [wiki](https://github.com/denniskb/hy475/wiki).
